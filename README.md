# University at Buffalo - Anonymous decentralized crime reporting tool using Blockchain

Blockchain technology using Ethereum is slowly evolving and provides us with endless possiblities. This is a protoype of an anonymous crime reporting tool which students of UB can use to provide information on any crimes they witnessed on campus. These reports can then be consolidated using user credibility in the blockchain. 

Students will also recieve campus cash rewards for legitimate information and banned from the portal if found that they were providing false information.
